  <p>
    A demo data-set is available here:<a href="Demo_POPC.tiff" download="Demo_POPC.tiff">Demo_POPC.tiff</a>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16pt;font-family:'Avenir'">1. Reduction</span></p>
  <p>
   To get started, go to the Reduction tab and select the image data you want to analyze. Only .tif and .tiff files are currently supported.<br><br>
   Next, choose the points of interest that will determine the slices to be analyzed. Input the corresponding Q_z parameters, separated by commas (ignoring spaces).<br><br>
   After that, provide the instrument parameters, such as the sample-to-detector distance (mm), detector pixel size (mm), origin in x (pixels), and specify whether the origin should be detected or read from provided values.<br><br>
   Before submitting on this tab, indicate if there is distortion in either dimension of Q space, so the necessary corrections can be applied.<br><br>
   Once everything is set, press submit and wait for all processes to complete. Afterward, you can download the outputs.zip file, which contains all the graphs and plots saved in .png format. Additionally, it includes a .pkl file of the X-ray object used, a .json file with data for displaying the Plotly figures, and a .dat file for the Fitting tab. Note that the zip file is not required for using the Fitting tab.

  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16pt;font-family:'Avenir'">1. Fitting</span></p>
  <p>
   Moving from the Reduction tab to the Fitting tab, not all parameters need to be changed. The user needs to input the start values for Xi (ξ, Angstroms) and Eta (η, arbitrary unit) as well as the d-spacing in q (Angstroms^(-1)), which represents the position of the first order Bragg peak. However, it is important to note that Domain Size Lr (Angstroms) and Domain Size spread si (Angstroms) are instrument-specific parameters. It is recommended to refer to our publication before making any changes to these values.<br><br>
   Once the correct parameters are entered, click submit. After the fitting process is completed, two values will be displayed: Bending Modulus and Interaction Modulus. Below them, there will be an additional outputs.zip download containing the previously mentioned contents, as well as the fitting plots. The Xi^2 convergence is shown at the top, while the fit results plot is displayed at the bottom.<br><br>
   That covers all the necessary information. Now, you can proceed back to the Reduction tab for analysis.<br><br>
